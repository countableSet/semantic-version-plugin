:version: 1.0.0

Gradle plugin to auto-increments the patch version on each call to the `publish` task by looking up the most recent version published in the publishing maven repository and adds it by one.

Tested to work in the following scenarios:

. Single root project publication
. Single and multiple subprojects publication
. BOM references via `api(platform(project(":bom")))` and `java-platform` plugin
. Manual versioning, prevents the task from publishing if the version isn't different from the one in maven

== Usage

=== Auto mode

Basic full example, but it can also be used for subprojects and bom subprojects. However, make sure the publication version number is in the format of `[\d]+\.[\d]+`.

[source,kotlin,subs="attributes"]
----
plugins {
    java
    `maven-publish`
    id("dev.poolside.gradle.semantic-version") version "{version}"
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

group = "dev.poolside.test"
version = "0.1"

publishing {
    publications {
        create<MavenPublication>("mavenJava") {
            artifactId = "my-library"
            from(components["java"])
        }
    }
}
----

=== Manual mode

If there's a scenario in which you want to manually increment the semantic version. Therefore, the plugin will disable publishing if the version already exists in the repository.

[source,kotlin]
----
semanticVersion {
    manual = true
}
----

== Gradle Version Requirement

The plugin now requires Gradle version 8.11+ to access new access.
